== Cross-cutting Concepts

////
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Domain concepts and model


[plantuml,"Sequence diagram",png]
----
@startuml
User -- Route
User -- User : hasFriend
Route "1" *--> "1..*" Waypoint
Route "1" *--> "0..*" UserComment
Waypoint o-- "0..*" Image
Waypoint o-- "0..*" Video
@enduml
----

A *route* must contain a name, optionally it can have a description.
Its composed by at least one waypoint and may or not have a list of comments and media.

The *Waypoint* must have latitude and longitude. They can have as optional properties a name, altitude and a physical address.

A *userComment* must contain the text of the comment, the time it was published and the author, being the last one a IRI to a pod profile shape.

And finally, an *Image* or a *Video* must have an IRI to te resource, another IRI to the pod profile of the author and the time it was published


=== User Experience concepts (UX)

User Experience is one of the main goals of our application, as apps with bad UX fail often. Therefore, we should make a great effort to build Viade as an intuitive app that facilitates its use to all types of users and proficiency levels.

Performance is too a key factor in User Experience. As Viade will have to show a map most of the time we should strive to achieve the quickest loading times possible.


=== Safety and security

The application must use secure communication channels. This is achieved by using the protocols
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818[HTTPS] and https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/WebID/raw-file/tip/spec/tls-respec.html[WebID-TLS].
With them we ensure te authenticity and integrity of the data sended and received from the pods.

It is also important that the application validates all input data from the users. 
All the data must be consistent and saved in the persistent storage following the standard RDF
under a valid schema.

=== Testability

With great tests comes great software. 

Tests to consider implementing:

* Acceptance tests
* Browser test
* Load/Stress tests

=== Performance

Both performance and efficiency(the degree with which software fulfils its purpose without waste of resources) are essential attributes for any piece of software, especially when the user has a choice regarding which app to use.

As mentioned in UX, how an app performs can determine whether it will succeed or not. In particular, we will have to guarantee the functionality of the app in low spec devices if we want to extend the app towards phones in the future.

Accomplishing this should be done following good architectural/design practices.


=== Architecture and design patterns

Viade is a React based app, therefore it follows the Model View Controller(MVC) architecture. 

Persistence in Viade will be achieved following the SOLID specification.

General note: our aim is to achieve a system that is maintainable, reliable, scalable and performant. We will work towards these goals using different design patterns to the best of our ability.



=== Internacionalization

We believe that support fo multiple languages is an important feature that our sofware should fulfill.
Therefore, we try from the beginning to make it internationalizable. It must be easy to add new languages.

Localization should also be considered, showing the formats of dates, units and so on of the corresponding region.

The first one consists of clicking the points of the map which the route will go through. Once done, the edit mode is deactivated by double clicking the last route point or by clicking again the starting point in the case of the route being cyclic. Lastly, a form must be filled with the name and a description for the route, being this last field optional.</1><1>Import a route: Once selected the file with GPX extension, the stored routes will be displayed on the map and will automatically be stored in your POD.</1><1>Friends management: From this screen you can add friends to your POD by inserting their Web ID.
